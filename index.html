          Hi, my name is Kerrick. I live in Naples, FL and currently attend the
          University of Florida in the class of 2023. I am
          majoring in computer science with a minor in electrical engineering. I
          am currently employed as a software developer for UF Digital Worlds
          Institute. I was first exposed to coding in my high school computer
          class and have been in love ever since. I started my journey in Java,
          but have recently taken an interest in JavaScript/NodeJS, C++, and
          Python development. In addition to my excellent academic record, I am
          involved in many clubs at UF including UF Florida Engineering Society,
          UF Gatorloop, and UF Software Engineering Club. I also recently
          completed an internship at Adaptive Computing as a developer. Check
          out some of my work and feel free to contact me anytime! Thanks for
          visiting!
