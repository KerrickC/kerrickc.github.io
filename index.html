          Senior computer science and electrical engineering student at the University of Florida. My relevant experience through internships, research projects, and university employment (teacher assistant) has gifted me (1) the analytical and technical skills to tackle problems efficiently, (2) the ability to communicate and collaborate effectively within any team. Through my internships, research positions, and professional experience, I have gained experience with NodeJS, C++, Python, DICOM image processing, ReactJS, JavaScript, Docker, Cloud, HPC, Agile development, CI/CD, and Linux. Although, I can adapt my knowledge and experience to any task given to me. My interests include: defense/aerospace software, financial software, cybersecurity, backend development, AI, and automation.
